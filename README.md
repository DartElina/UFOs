## Overview of Project:
Dana has created a UFO sighting website that sorted UFO sighting data by date that users input. I liked her site very much but decided to create some more interactivity by adding more filter options. Additionally, Dana's site had a button that had to be clicked. To improve user experience I have enabled the table to be filter by entering any info into the field, and removed the button clicking entirely.

## Results: 
### Before:

The image above shows Dana's site with only one filter option and the unsorted table to the right. 
### Suggested Improvements:
With more filter options users can narow down very specific sightings down. See additional filter options below:

### Examples of Use:
Entering some variables into the fields yeilds a targeted and clear table.

## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

I still wish we can learn more from the data collected! Perhaps creating a dashboard that allows users more interactivity? We could add a national map that contains info on frequency of sightings and duration like a bubble chart. We could also add a dropdown menu that allows users to choose what the map shows.
